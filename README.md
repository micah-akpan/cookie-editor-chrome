# cookie-editor-chrome

An easy-to-use cookie extension to speed up cookie changes during development. Use this software in cases where you need to manipulate session id cookies for any host to verify client auth states, set, and save multi-variant or A/B test cookies, manipulate tokens, and the list is endless as long as it involves playing with cookies.

Features you get out of the box:
- Make changes to a cookie by the cookie name and the index you wish to change
- Copy set cookie; this could make it easy to share the cookie for testing with other developers
- Save a frequently-used cookie host URL (optional)
- Overwrite the cookie in store (optional)
- Modify any host's cookie from a tab not associated with the host
- Helpful debugging errors
